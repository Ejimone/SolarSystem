# Title: 3D Visualization of the Solar System

## Abstract
This report presents the development and implementation of the "Solar System Explorer," an interactive web application designed to educate users about the solar system. The application integrates advanced technologies such as 3D visualization, augmented reality (AR), and interactive quizzes to create an engaging learning experience. This document details the project's objectives, methodology, features, and outcomes, providing a comprehensive overview of its educational impact.

## Introduction
The Solar System Explorer aims to bridge the gap between education and technology by offering an interactive platform for learning about space. The application targets students and educators, providing tools to explore celestial objects, understand planetary characteristics, and engage in space-related activities. This report outlines the project's motivation, objectives, and scope.
